## Description of the Project

This is the first out of a four part project assigned by Holberton School
that recreates a simple copy of the Airbnb website. The Console is a
command interpreter that manipulates data without a visual interface.
Through it we will be managing (creating, updating, destroying) objects
while also storing them to a JSON file.

## Description of the Command Interpreter
  * To start the console, run the executable file console.py:
```
./console.py
```
  * How to use its commands:
    - **all** - prints string representation of all objects of a certain class
    - **create** - creates a new instance of class provided as argument
    - **destroy** - deletes an instance based on class name and id
    - **help** - shows list of commands and how to use help command
    - **help <topic>** - provides info on specific command
    - **quit** or **EOF** - exits the program
    - **show** - prints string representation of an instance from class name and id

## Examples

  * all command:
  * create command: 
  * destroy command: 
  * help command: 
  * help <\topic> command: 
  * quit or EOF command: 
  * show command:
